## Education
- MSc., Embedded and Computer Engineering | TU Delft (_October 2024_)
- BSc., Electrical Engineering | Inholland Alkmaar (_July 2022_)

## Work Experience
**Research Scientist @ TU Delft | Grussmayer Lab (_Januari 2025 - Present_)**
- Developed a **(Focus Lock)[https://ir.amolf.nl/pub/10774/16893publishedVersion.pdf]** system to correct for lateral drift by adjusting the axial position of the microscope, enabling stable live-cell and single-molecule imaging.
- Contributed to the development of **Fast (SOFI)[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super-resolution_optical_fluctuation_imaging]** (Super-resolution Optical Fluctuation Imaging) using deep learning, with the goal of enabling real-time imaging in live-cell applications. Ultimately, the model reconstructs super-resolved images from just 8 low-resolution frames, achieving a two-fold improvement in spatial resolution.
- Supporting the preparation of a **scientific publication** based on prior contributions to deep-learning-based SOFI acceleration during MSc research.

**Software Engineer @ VU Amsterdam | Electronics Group (_August 2022 - Present_)**
- Co-developing **LabOrch**, a Python-based lab orchestrator designed to control scientific instrumentation through a modular microservices architecture. Enables seamless integration of diverse lab devices with unified control, real-time feedback, metadata handling, and a logging API layer.
- Developed the embedded software architecture for the **Line Controller**, an industrial Ethernet (Modbus-based) device used to control scientific instrumentation via various digital and analog hardware interfaces.

**Intern Electronics Engineer @ LUMICKS (_Februari 2022 - June 2022_)**
-  Designed an FPGA-based demo system for the C-Trap [optical tweezer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_tweezers) to explore integration of beam steering (Piezo, EOD, AOD) and force sensing (PSDs, sCMOS) using a high-bandwidth PID control loop.
